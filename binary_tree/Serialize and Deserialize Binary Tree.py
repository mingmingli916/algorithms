"""
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits
so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer,
or transmitted across a network connection link
to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree.
There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work.
You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and
this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree.
You do not necessarily need to follow this format,
so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.



Example 1:


Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
Example 2:

Input: root = []
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
Example 4:

Input: root = [1,2]
Output: [1,2]


Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
