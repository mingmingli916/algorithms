"""
You are given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and previous pointers,
it could have a child pointer, which may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list.
These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure,
as shown in the example below.

Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list.
You are given the head of the first level of the list.



Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]
Output: [1,2,3,7,8,11,12,9,10,4,5,6]
Explanation:

The multilevel linked list in the input is as follows:



After flattening the multilevel linked list it becomes:


Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2,null,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
Explanation:

The input multilevel linked list is as follows:

  1---2---NULL
  |
  3---NULL
Example 3:

Input: head = []
Output: []

Constraints:

The number of Nodes will not exceed 1000.
1 <= Node.val <= 10^5
