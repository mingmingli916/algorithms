"""
Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]


Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 300
nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2.


Follow up: Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant extra space?

   Hide Hint #1
A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
   Hide Hint #2
Iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's.
   Hide Hint #3
Overwrite array with the total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
